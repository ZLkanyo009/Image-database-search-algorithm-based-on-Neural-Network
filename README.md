# Image-database-search-algorithm-based-on-Neural-Network
Using the classic MNIST data set to build the image database, the search algorithm uses neural network, and uses the digital 0-9 image drawn by oneself as the new image to retrieve the similar images in the image database, and copies all the similar images in the image database to similar_ IMG folder for users to check.

# Installation Dependencies:
